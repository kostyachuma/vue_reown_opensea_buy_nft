# Token Optimization Rules

## Code Generation Guidelines
- Provide minimal, focused code
- Avoid verbose explanations unless critical
- Use concise variable and function names
- Prefer one-liners where possible
- Don't create unnecessary functions or features
- Only implement what's explicitly requested
- Avoid over-engineering solutions

## Response Format
- Use bullet points instead of paragraphs
- Show code, don't describe it extensively
- Skip obvious comments in code blocks

## Tool Usage Efficiency
- Batch multiple file reads/edits in parallel
- Use specific line ranges when reading large files
- Combine related operations in single tool calls
- Skip redundant file operations

## Production Code Requirements
- Generate production-ready code only
- Use TypeScript types correctly
- Follow established patterns from existing codebase

## Communication Style
- Direct answers without preambles
- Use "âœ…" for confirmations instead of long sentences
- Show working code immediately
- Skip "Here's how..." or "Let me explain..." phrases
