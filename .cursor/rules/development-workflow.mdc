# Development Workflow

## Environment Variables
```bash
VITE_PROJECT_ID=your_reown_project_id
VITE_OPENSEA_API_KEY=your_opensea_api_key
```

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` - Development server
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run type-check` - TypeScript validation

## Testing Strategy
1. **Polygon** - Low gas costs
2. **Mainnet** - Final testing

## Debugging
- Check wallet connection in console
- Verify network IDs
- Log OpenSea API responses
- Monitor transactions in block explorers

## Security
- Never commit `.env` files
- Test on testnets first
- Validate user inputs
- Use environment-specific API keys
